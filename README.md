# React Weather Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Weather Application! This project was developed to practice working with APIs and enhancing styling skills. It provides real-time weather information for locations around the world. The application is built using React and utilizes packages like react-accessible-accordion and react-select-async-paginate to offer a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Project Goals

1. API Integration: Gain experience in working with external APIs by fetching and displaying real-time weather data.

2. UI/UX Design: Improve UI/UX design skills by creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users.

3. User Interaction: Implement features like city search and unit conversion to enhance user interaction.

4. Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## Challenges

While building the React Weather Application, several challenges were encountered and overcome:

1. API Integration: Integrating external APIs and handling data fetching asynchronously required careful implementation.

2. Styling: Achieving a responsive and visually pleasing design presented challenges in terms of CSS and layout.

3. Accessibility: Ensuring the application is accessible to all users, including those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation, required attention to detail.
